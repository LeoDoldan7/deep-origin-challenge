# üîó Deep Origin URL Shortener Challenge ‚Äì by Leo Doldan

This project is a full-stack URL shortener built with **React + TypeScript** on the frontend and **Node.js + NestJS + Prisma** on the backend. It allows users to sign up, shorten URLs, customize slugs, track visits, and manage their personal dashboard.

## üìù Notes

Some security or production concerns (e.g., email verification, strong password policies) were skipped intentionally to focus on functionality. Rate-limiting is simple and in-memory for demonstration.

Enjoy!
